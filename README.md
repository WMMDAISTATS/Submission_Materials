# Additional submission materials for the paper *A fair Kernel Two Sample Test*.

This repository contains an implementation of the WMMD and other two sample test. The goal is to test disitrbutional difference between samples of two populations *after* adjusting for covariate values of confounding variables that may obscure the true relationship between populations. Crucially we assume access to biased populations rather that the true populations of interest.

We provide a tutorial with a step by step procedure on a toy example to illustrate the use of the WMMD in Example.ipynb.
