# Additional submission materials for the paper *A fair Kernel Two Sample Test*.

This repository contains an implementation of the WMMD and other two sample tests. The goal of this project is to test distributional difference between independent samples of two *biased* populations, the true distributions are observed up to the distorsion introduced by confounding variables.

We provide a tutorial with a step by step procedure on a toy example to illustrate the use of the WMMD in Tutorial.ipynb.

This code borrowed heavily from the MMD implementation in https://github.com/wittawatj/interpretable-test.
